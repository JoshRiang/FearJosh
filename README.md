## Overview

**JOSHU DITAKUTI** is a psychological survival horror game where players explore a school that has been sealed off as an active crime scene. The building hides a tragedy that occurred during graduation night — and something is still inside.

Players must survive by managing limited resources, avoiding a relentless entity, and uncovering fragments of a buried truth.

## Story

### The Tragedy of “Malam Kelulusan”

Josh was a student who endured years of bullying. He carried deep emotional pain, but unlike the rumors that spread afterward, **Josh never intended to burn down the school**.

On the night of the graduation party in the Great Hall, surrounded by celebration and lingering mockery, Josh’s body reacted to unbearable emotional pressure.

He did not scream in tears.  
He transformed.

### Timeline of the Incident
- Graduation night celebration in the Great Hall
- Josh collapsed and began convulsing
- His body mutated into a monstrous form
- The hall was destroyed by physical rampage, not fire
- Multiple casualties occurred; others escaped
- Police surrounded the school but weapons were ineffective
- The building was fully sealed and declared an active crime scene

### Current Status
The school remains sealed behind police lines.  
Josh is still trapped inside — alone, in his monstrous form.
